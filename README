TODO
----
- connections needs a ; separated list of transport types
- language support

Comments
--------
- Vehicle and Liveboard calls are set with fast=true options. See API docs.
"Because of the recent changes in the internal system we were not able to link every station to a geolocation and internal id. Therefore we had to write a very slow workaround for this. If you 
don't need geocoordinates or the id, add: &fast=true to your URL."
- Liveboard only takes the name of a station, not the ID of a vehicle
